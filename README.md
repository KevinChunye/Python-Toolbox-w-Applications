# Toolbox_Application
Contains some of the basic python applications for me(and who ever saw this) quickly pick up and review python.
From basic algorithms to loops, turtle, OOP(class), data type, data structure, list comprehension [value for (key, value) in data.items()]，GUI(tkinter), API(for news, weather, stock), sms(text message sending through Twilio), email sending... and more in the future.




The reward for hard work is more work…kno dat.
